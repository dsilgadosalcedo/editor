# Duplicate Projects Issue Fix

## The Problem

When users visited `/canvas` without internet connectivity, the authentication system would retry/fail, causing the `useEffect` in `app/canvas/page.tsx` to fire multiple times. Each time it fired, it called `handleCreateNew()`, which created multiple "Untitled Project" entries in local storage.

## The Root Cause

The issue was in `/app/canvas/page.tsx`:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isLoadingProjects) {
    return;
  }
  handleCreateNew(); // This was called every time dependencies changed
}, [handleCreateNew, isLoadingProjects, router]);
```

When there was no internet, the authentication state would keep changing, triggering this effect multiple times and creating many duplicate projects.

## The Solution

### 1. Fixed the Multiple Creation Issue

Modified `/app/canvas/page.tsx` to prevent multiple project creations:

```typescript
const creationInProgress = useRef(false);
const hasCreated = useRef(false);

useEffect(() => {
  // Prevent multiple project creations
  if (hasCreated.current || creationInProgress.current) {
    return;
  }

  if (isLoadingProjects) {
    return;
  }

  // Mark creation as in progress to prevent duplicate calls
  creationInProgress.current = true;
  hasCreated.current = true;

  handleCreateNew().finally(() => {
    creationInProgress.current = false;
  });
}, [handleCreateNew, isLoadingProjects]);
```

### 2. Added Cleanup Functionality

Added utility functions in `/lib/project-storage.ts`:

- `cleanupDuplicateProjects()` - Removes duplicate "Untitled Project" entries, keeping only the most recent one
- `getDuplicateProjectStats()` - Returns statistics about duplicate projects

### 3. Added UI for Cleanup

Added a "Clean Duplicates" button to the projects page that:

- Only appears when there are 2+ untitled projects
- Shows the count of duplicates
- Removes all but the most recent duplicate when clicked
- Updates the UI with a success message

## How to Use the Fix

1. **Prevention**: The fix prevents new duplicates from being created when visiting `/canvas`
2. **Cleanup**: If you already have duplicates, go to `/projects` and click the "Clean Duplicates" button
3. **Automatic**: The cleanup button only appears when needed and automatically disappears after cleaning

## Files Modified

- `app/canvas/page.tsx` - Fixed multiple creation issue
- `lib/project-storage.ts` - Added cleanup utilities
- `features/projects/hooks/useHybridProjects.ts` - Added cleanup functionality
- `features/projects/components/ProjectsPage.tsx` - Added cleanup UI

## Testing

The fix has been tested with:

- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ No multiple project creation when auth state changes
- ✅ Cleanup functionality works as expected
